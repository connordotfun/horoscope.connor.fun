## Quote Formatting

Quotes can be formatted with full markdown support. Each quote should be exactly one line in the
appropriate txt file. Quotes can also run arbitrary JavaScript to ensure correctness of their
predictions. JS can be executed using double curly-braces: `{{ somejs.here }}`. Along with standard
JS 1.5 objects, a `sign` and `date` object are provided. 

`sign` provides the name and details of the correct astral sign:

```json
{
    name: "Aquarius",
    start: "01-20",
    end: "02-18"
},
```

`date` provides the date in several useful formats:

```json
{
    day: "Sunday",
    day_of_month: "10",
    day_of_year: "161",
    full_date: "06-10-2018",
    month: "June",
    month_number: "6",
    quarter: "2",
    year: "2018"
}
```
